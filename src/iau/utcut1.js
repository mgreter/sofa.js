function iauUtcut1(utc1, utc2, dut1)
/*
**  - - - - - - - - - -
**   i a u U t c u t 1
**  - - - - - - - - - -
**
**  Time scale transformation:  Coordinated Universal Time, UTC, to
**  Universal Time, UT1.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical.
**
**  Given:
**     utc1,utc2  double   UTC as a 2-part quasi Julian Date (Notes 1-4)
**     dut1       double   Delta UT1 = UT1-UTC in seconds (Note 5)
**
**  Returned:
**     ut11,ut12  double   UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 6)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                int      status: +1 = dubious year (Note 3)
**                                  0 = OK
**                                 -1 = unacceptable date
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) utc1+utc2 is quasi Julian Date (see Note 2), apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments, for example where utc1
**     is the Julian Day Number and utc2 is the fraction of a day.
**
**  2) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
**     special measures are taken.  The convention in the present
**     function is that the JD day represents UTC days whether the
**     length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.
**
**  3) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
**     introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future
**     to be trusted.  See iauDat for further details.
**
**  4) The function iauDtf2d converts from calendar date and time of
**     day into 2-part Julian Date, and in the case of UTC implements
**     the leap-second-ambiguity convention described above.
**
**  5) Delta UT1 can be obtained from tabulations provided by the
**     International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service.
**     It is the caller's responsibility to supply a dut1 argument
**     containing the UT1-UTC value that matches the given UTC.
**
**  6) The returned ut11,ut12 are such that their sum is the UT1 Julian
**     Date.
